# Fullstack Bun UI Library

Welcome to the **Fullstack Bun UI Component Library**! This is a comprehensive collection of reusable React components built with modern web technologies.

## Overview

This component library is designed to provide a consistent, accessible, and themeable set of UI components for the Fullstack Bun project. All components are built with:

- **React 19** - Latest React features and optimizations
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Radix UI** - Accessible component primitives
- **Class Variance Authority (CVA)** - Type-safe component variants
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety and IntelliSense support

## Features

### Theme Support

All components support **light** and **dark** themes out of the box. Use the theme switcher in the toolbar (moon/sun icon) to preview components in different themes.

The theme system uses:
- CSS custom properties for easy customization
- OKLch color space for perceptually uniform colors
- Automatic system preference detection

### Accessibility

Components are built on top of Radix UI primitives, ensuring:
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- ARIA attributes
- Focus management

### Variants

Many components support multiple visual variants and sizes through CVA, providing flexibility while maintaining type safety.

## Available Components

### Form Components
- **Button** - Primary interactive element with multiple variants
- **Input** - Text input with various types including checkbox
- **Textarea** - Multi-line text input
- **Label** - Form labels with variants

### Layout Components
- **Card** - Container for content with header, footer, and action slots
- **Container** - Max-width centered container

### Overlay Components
- **Dialog** - Modal dialogs for important interactions
- **Popover** - Floating content panels
- **DropdownMenu** - Contextual menus with advanced features

### Navigation Components
- **Link** - Standard link with primary styling
- **StyledLink** - Link component with button variants

## Getting Started

### Installation

This library is part of the Fullstack Bun monorepo and is available as the `frontend-common` workspace package.

```bash
# The package is already available in the monorepo
import { Button } from 'frontend-common/components/ui';
```

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { Button, Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from 'frontend-common/components/ui';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Welcome</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <p>Get started with our components</p>
        <Button>Click me</Button>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### Using Themes

Wrap your application with the `ThemeProvider`:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'frontend-common/providers';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider defaultTheme="system" storageKey="app-theme">
      {/* Your app content */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

### Import Styles

Import the theme CSS in your application:

```tsx
import 'frontend-common/styles/theme.css';
```

## Component Documentation

Each component in this library has:

- **Interactive examples** - Try out components with different props
- **Controls** - Modify component properties in real-time
- **Auto-generated docs** - Prop types and descriptions
- **Usage examples** - Common patterns and use cases

Navigate through the sidebar to explore all available components.

## Design Principles

### Simplicity
Components are designed to be easy to use with sensible defaults while remaining flexible for advanced use cases.

### Consistency
Visual design and behavior patterns are consistent across all components.

### Accessibility
All components follow WCAG guidelines and best practices for accessibility.

### Performance
Components are optimized for performance with minimal re-renders and efficient styling.

## Color System

The theme uses CSS custom properties with the following semantic tokens:

- **Background** - Main background colors
- **Foreground** - Text colors
- **Primary** - Brand/accent colors
- **Secondary** - Supporting colors
- **Muted** - Subtle backgrounds and text
- **Accent** - Hover states and highlights
- **Destructive** - Error and delete actions
- **Border** - Border colors
- **Input** - Form input backgrounds
- **Ring** - Focus ring colors

## Contributing

1. Follow existing patterns and conventions
2. Ensure full TypeScript support
3. Add comprehensive Storybook stories
