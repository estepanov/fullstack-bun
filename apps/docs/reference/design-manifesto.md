# Design Manifesto

This manifesto defines the visual and interaction principles for all user-facing
experiences in this repo. It is the shared contract for future design work.

## Principles
- Clarity over novelty. Every pixel should earn its place.
- Quiet confidence. Use restraint, but never feel timid or generic.
- Depth without noise. Layering and light create hierarchy, not clutter.
- Motion with intent. Animate only to inform or guide.
- Craft matters. Typography, spacing, and alignment are non-negotiable.

## Typography
- Primary type is humanist and precise. Use an expressive sans that feels modern,
  technical, and calm.
- Headings are tight and confident; body text is airy and readable.
- Favor sentence case for UI copy. Avoid excess punctuation and shouting.

## Color
- Neutrals lead; color accents guide. The interface is built on calm neutrals
  with purposeful, limited accent use.
- Primary actions are blue-forward and unambiguous. Destructive actions are red.
- Backgrounds are layered with subtle gradients to keep the surface alive.

## Layout and Spacing
- Use generous vertical rhythm. Dense layouts should still breathe.
- Cards feel light and elevated, with soft edges and subtle borders.
- Align to a grid and keep left edges clean for fast scanning.

## Motion
- Prefer short, eased transitions (120-200ms).
- Stagger only when it improves comprehension.
- Avoid decorative motion; the experience should feel fast and direct.

## Components
- Buttons are pill-shaped with confident weight.
- Inputs are soft-edged, quiet, and focus states are unmistakable.
- Status badges are minimal and legible, using color sparingly.

## Content
- Write like a calm expert: short sentences, clear actions, no fluff.
- Empty states guide the next action in one sentence.

## Accessibility
- Maintain strong contrast for text and interactive elements.
- Focus states are always visible.
- Touch targets are at least 40px in height.
